## [0.2.0](https://github.com/in-scope/ciag-toolbox/compare/v0.1.2...v0.2.0) (2026-05-14)

This is the first major content release after the initial scaffold. It introduces
the full image-loading, viewport-rendering, and operations stack that lets MSI Toolbox
load real multispectral data, inspect it, transform it, and save the result as a project.

### Multi-band image support

* **CT-056:** active-band radio model for the Bands panel and Keep Bands modal
* **refactor(subset-bands):** replace Keep Bands modal with an inline right-panel section and toolbar toggle

### Grid layout and viewport management

* **CT-042:** add 1x3 and 3x1 grid layouts
* **CT-043:** collapse grid layout when closing a loaded viewport
* **CT-044:** auto-grow grid layout when opening an image
* **CT-045:** hide close and duplicate context-menu items on empty viewports
* **fix(grid):** preserve loaded images when collapsing layout on viewport close
* **fix(history):** inherit source viewport rendering state when duplicating

### Metadata and history

* **CT-035:** operation history audit trail with right-panel display
* **CT-036:** right-panel image metadata section with empty state

### Project save and export

* **CT-031:** image export with TIFF/PNG/JPEG format chooser

* **CT-033:** project state save and load via `.ctproj`
* **CT-034:** pack project as `.ctbundle` archive with streaming zip
* **CT-053:** bundle-only project save with baked assets

### Performance

* **CT-051:** busy-state context and loading indicators for long-running flows
* **perf(stack-open):** stream files one at a time to avoid renderer OOM

### Theming

* **CT-046:** default theme to dark on first launch
* **CT-047:** strengthen panel borders in light theme

### Bug fixes

* **fix(CT-048):** clear stale ROI overlay after crop and tool toggle
* **fix(open-images-review):** smart file size display, single-row mode menu, image title, multi-band drag lock

### App identity

* MSI Toolbox app icon and startup splash screen

### Continuous Integration

* Initial release-please workflow ([#3](https://github.com/in-scope/ciag-toolbox/issues/3))
* Wire release-please into the build workflow so installers upload to the release ([#5](https://github.com/in-scope/ciag-toolbox/pull/5))
